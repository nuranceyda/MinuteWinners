Hello!

Welcome to the Minute Winners Game!
Our game is a series of online one minute long mini-games playable on any mobile device, like your phone!
To join, simply go to the link above on your phone and wait for the game to start! There is a brief waiting period to allow for multiple players to join. This period may be longer when first playing. (Up to 2 minutes of waiting!)

There are three games that are randomly selected to play every 30 seconds!

Tricky Tapping: tap your phone as much as possible!

Dance Around: dance around with your phone. The more you move, the more points you earn!

Stay Sneaky Still: keep your phone as still as possible to earn more!


After each game, the highest score of all the players is annouced, followed by your own score.
Keep playing to try and get the highest score of all your friends!

*Note: you can use a computer to play, but you will not be able to earn as many points because we unfornately can't feel how much you are dancing or staying still!
